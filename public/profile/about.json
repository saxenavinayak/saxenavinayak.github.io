    "about": "I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on data engineering, cloud comptuing, and distributed systems. I have experience with real-time data and ETL pipelines, building infrastracture, and optimizing cloud workloads. I have gained this experience through 2 years of internship work. Outside of work, I enjoy to learn (currently I am building an audio synthesizer in Rust), rock climbing (not to flex but I can climb a V6), going to the gym, and playing Apex Legends (I'm pretty good at it!).",
